Integrated OpenWeatherMap API to fetch real-time weather data based on user input. Displays temperature, conditions, and wind speed dynamically.

# 🌦️ Task 05 - Weather Web App

This repository contains my submission for **Task 05** of the **Web Development Internship at Prodigy Infotech**. The objective of this task was to build a responsive **Weather App** that fetches real-time weather data using the **OpenWeatherMap API**.

## 🚀 Features

- 🌍 Search weather by city name
- 🌡️ Displays temperature, humidity, wind speed, and weather condition
- 🌈 Dynamic icons for different weather types
- 💬 Displays helpful error messages for invalid city inputs
- 📱 Fully responsive on all devices

---

## 🔧 Technologies Used

- **HTML5** – for webpage structure  
- **CSS3** – for styling and responsiveness  
- **JavaScript (ES6)** – for logic and API integration  
- **OpenWeatherMap API** – to fetch real-time weather data

## 🔍 How It Works

1. The user enters a **city name** in the input field.
2. On clicking "Search", JavaScript sends a request to **OpenWeatherMap API** using `fetch()`.
3. The app parses the JSON response and displays:
   - City name
   - Current temperature
   - Weather description and icon
   - Humidity and wind speed
4. If an invalid city is entered, the app displays an error message.

## 📚 What I Learned

- Working with **public APIs** and handling **asynchronous operations**
- Managing **user input validation** and errors
- Updating DOM dynamically using JavaScript
- Building responsive layouts using **Flexbox and media queries**
- Using **API keys securely** (note: avoid exposing keys in production)

---

## 🧠 Improvements for Future

- Add background image changes based on weather conditions
- Auto-detect user location with Geolocation API
- Add support for temperature unit toggle (°C/°F)
- Save last searched city using localStorage
